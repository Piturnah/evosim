# Evosim - Evolution by Natural Selection!
[Explanation Video](https://youtu.be/dcqPfK9CvVQ)

This is a fun little project simulating evolution by natural selection on a very basic level. It simulates an environment which is instantiated with a thousand creatures with random "genes" and some food, and over time the creatures live and die and reproduce. When creatures mate, each of the offspring's traits is decided by choosing the trait of either the mother or father and then mutating it by a small amount. With these simple rules, evolution can occur!
